Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: 
Yes, the 3 model architectures correctly classified.

2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: 
VGG and ResNet correctly identified Dog_01.jpg and Dog_02.jpg as german shepherd, german shepherd dog, AlexNet classified Dog_01.jpg and Dog_02.jpg as prairie wolf, brush wolf.

3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: 
The 3 model architectures identified the Dog_01.jpg as a non-dog, and correctly classified it as a 'coffee mug' and 'bald eagle'.

4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer:
VGG and ResNet identified correctly both models identified the eagle as such, and did not mistake it for a dog. At the end Best performing model architecture was ResNet, because of its runtime of 00:00:04. Indeed, VGG took 00:00:09 time to complete the task.
